# Weird Square

Weird Square is weird

A learning experience at ElixirCamp IV Oct 2018.

I wanted to try using Cowboy directly (no Phoenix) to manage websockets
with an Elm frontend.

It started out as an idea for multiple connections each controlling a
square of a random colour. Right at the end it turned into super mario
instead of a square...

I also tried using Elm animations for the first time.

# Running it

Install elixir 1.7 and elm 0.19.
There's a .tool-versions file so go ahead and use asdf to install.

Run ./go
